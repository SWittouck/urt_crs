# The upper respiratory tract microbiome of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis

This Rmarkdown document describes the data analysis for the paper "Topographical diversity of the microbiome in the upper respiratory tract: focus on chronic rhinosinusitis" by De Boeck, Wittouck, Martens et al. (the title may have changed slightly). All data visualizations and summary tables shown in the paper are generated by this document. You can read this document to get a more detailed overview of the data analysis, or you can run the code yourself and play around with it if you want to explore the data on your own. The easiest way to run the code is to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop). 

The data that is needed to run the code will be uploaded to this repo once the paper has been published.
